# AI-Powered-Smart-Email-Classifier-for-Enterprises

This project is a Machine Learning pipeline designed to classify customer communications into four distinct categories: **Complaints**, **Requests**, **Spam**, and **Feedback**.

It processes text data from multiple sources, cleans it using NLP techniques, trains a Logistic Regression model, and generates statistical visualizations of the text data.

##  Features

* **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Merges data from three different datasets (Customer Support Tickets, Spam Emails, and Amazon Reviews).
* **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**:
    * Lowercasing & Punctuation removal.
    * Regex cleaning (removing email addresses and URLs).
    * Stopword removal & Lemmatization (using NLTK).
* **Machine Learning**:
    * **Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
    * **Model**: Logistic Regression.
* **Visualization**: Generates and saves boxplots for word and character count distributions.
* **Export**: Saves the cleaned, processed, and labeled dataset to a CSV file.
